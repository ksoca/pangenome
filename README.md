# Spirochete pangenome

Project Title: Determining the family-level spirocheteal pangenome project

Project Description: This repository is for determining the extent of the spirochetal pangenome.

The pangenome is the complete collection of all genes available within a given group of organisms. In this project I am expanding on work that was previously done by Mongodin et al in 2013. The goal of this project is to identify the core of the family of spirochetes and to see if there is a distinct differce between the spirochetes that can cause either Lyme borreliosis or Relapsing fever.

Materials and tools: 
For this project genomes were either downloaded sprichete fasta files from RefSeq as of October 2021 or sequenced within the Center for Genomic Sciecnes at Drexel University College of Medicine. The newly sequenced spirochetes will be uploaded to NCBI.

Afterwards, all analysis is done using RStudio (R (tidyr, ggplot, ggtree, heatmap2, EggNOG...)) or on the commandline. 

Data Prerequisites: 
- decent quality fasta files
